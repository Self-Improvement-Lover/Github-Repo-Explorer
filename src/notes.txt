/*Problem: 
we have om make a GitHub repo explorer, where there is a input bar and search are and when to clicked we give results of the username entered. We must make call to GitHub to get usernames. 
And then  when user is clicked, we must make sure that you can then see all their repo, with its name, description, number of stars, topics, and date created. 
And when any of repo is clicked, we take it to that repository page of that specific user. 

Breaking down the Problem:
 Ok just have an app component, that will have title of GitHub repository  explorer. 
Then we will have input bar and search bar. 
When user is entered, we make an Api call, and we loop over data array and show their picture, name and they will all have each  a state call show. F show is true, then their repos will be shown. We will have separate component for repo, as well as users. 
Repos will have 
info of name, description, stars, topics, and date created.
 We will have to access that from the Api call. 
We will do the design later. Now, when any of that repo card is clicked, we have to somehow open an new page for that, I donâ€™t know how o do that, will ask from ChatGPT and inshallah learn. 

lesson learnt: 
if you wan tot check if a fetch response has no data when it return it in function check if its
 length is 1 or bigger, not true since empty array is true
 browsers have become more consistent, so it isn't important to ue a css reset these days, though some people do a lightweight version
if content is overflowing form a container, decrease width of container so that its ok.
